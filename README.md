## Context 

This was a final showcase solo project for mod 3 at Turing School of Software and Design. I had six days to complete the project using this [provided comp](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html). I chose my own api to work with an my desired outcome for the app. 

## Learning Goals 

Demonstrate a mastery of: 
- React
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End to end testing with Cypress
- Responsiveness
- UI/UX 
- API calls
- User personas and user stories

## Challenges 
This project helped me see my understanding of react, router, and cypress at a higher level. I progressed well from that start and then my biggest challenge of the search/filter function occurred. I struggled getting the filter to re-filter based on if a user deletes a character from the input field and after hours of getting no where even with help, I went a different route and added a button instead to show all drinks. My other issues stemmed from Cypress testing. I had my stubs put in on all my tests except the one for the main page, and every time I tried to put it in, the test broke. I still want to go back and spend more time (I spent hours on this) on it. 


## Installation Instructions
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone it to your local machine using the green `<> CODE` button and paste that into your terminal with the command: `git clone <paste here>`
3. Run the command: `cd sober-spirit`
4. Run the command: `npm install`
5. Run the command: `npm start`
6. The application will open in your browser

## Plans for future iterations
- Fix search functionality to filter based on if a user types OR deletes a letter
- Add ability to favorite/unfavorite drinks and show them on their own page 
- Allow a user to organize their favorites themselves (being able to move the cards)
- Add ability to add a new drink 
- CSS effects on the boxes and big text
